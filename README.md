A clear problem statement:

A borrow-and-lend platform is designed to help users rent out their unused items for money while allowing others to borrow items at an affordable cost instead of purchasing them. The platform aims to promote a sharing economy, reduce waste, and provide a secure and convenient way for people to access resources.
Users can list items, set rental prices, and manage availability, while borrowers can search, request, and make secure payments for temporary use. Features like user verification, in-app messaging, reviews, and dispute resolution ensure trust and reliability. By leveraging technology, this platform creates a seamless borrowing and lending experience, benefiting both lenders and borrowers.
